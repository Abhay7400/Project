Recommendation Systems are one of the popular applications of Data Science for every e-commerce platform.
When it comes to fashion, an e-commerce platform wants to recommend the most trending fashion to its users for higher sales and engagement. 
Myntra is one of the popular e-commerce platforms known for its fashion recommendations. 



Fashion Recommendation System
A fashion recommendation system is an application that recommends the most trending fashion based on the userâ€™s search query.
For example, if a user is looking for a Kurti, the recommendation system will recommend the most trending or highly rated Kurtis on their platform.

To build a fashion recommendation system, 
we need a dataset based on fashion products. We collected data about Kurtis from Myntra that we can use to create a fashion recommendation system using Python.
